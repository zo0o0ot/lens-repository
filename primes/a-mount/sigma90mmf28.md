Info:

* Autofocus focus Prime lens.
* [Review - Dyxum](https://www.dyxum.com/reviews/lenses/Sigma-90mm-F2.8-Macro_review276.html)


My feelings:
* This lens was more or less the reason that I ended up buying an A mount camera (Sony A35)
* It can take some pretty nice images, but it kind of sucks when manually adapted out of the A mount.
