Info:

* Manual focus Prime lens.
* This was one of my first lens purchases.
* The aperture is declicked, which is nice for video but a little annoying for photos.
* 0.16 meters or 6.3 inch minimum focus distance. It's a pretty capable macro lens
* Reasonably cheap! I got mine on ebay for about 60 bucks.
* Solid metal construction.

My feelings:
* It's just fine at landscapes.  It's probably because I'm also just fine at landscapes.  It's not going to do anything magical if you don't have skill with landscape photography
* The 46 mm diameter lens means that if you have filters, they're probably going to have to use adapters to fit them on this lens.
* Declicked aperture is strange if you're used to clicking apertures from vintage lenses
