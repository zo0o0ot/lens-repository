Info:
* There doesn't appear to be much information about this lens online.
* [oldenguy lens review](https://youtu.be/5d4mDdwZa6Y?si=frYGk2bu3NpSfFxJ)
* Markings on lens indicate:
    - SEARS MOD. NO 202 7369000 KOREA
    - f=28mm    1:2.8   52mm lens size  No. 850604255   AUTO    MULTI-COATED


My feelings:
* The minimum focus distance of the lens is very close, but the focal plane is razor thin for macro shots. It looks pretty good in non-macro settings. There appears to be a fair amount of glow when there are light sources in the image.
